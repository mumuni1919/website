		<p>Gone are the days when oil ruled, it still important but data has taken over,<p>
		 I really find Data Science to web development fascinating but I am more inclinded towards Data Science <p>
		Machine learning is here to stay and I am happy to understand the process,<p>

		<h3>Environmental Protection</h3>

		<p>The latest efforts from governments and corporations to make provision and use of fossil fuels responsible is laudable,<p>
		 I find the measures being taken to reduce CO2 very responsible in safeguarding the future of our planet <p>
		So far as we havent replaced fossils fuels yet we need to use them responsibly while protecting our environment,<p>
		 so far the efforts being made are laudable and it must be sustained or improved</p>
